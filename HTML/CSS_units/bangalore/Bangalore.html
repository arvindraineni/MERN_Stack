    <p>Bengaluru, also spelled Bengalooru, formerly Bangalore, city, capital (since 1830) of Karnataka state, southern India. Bengaluru is one of India’s largest cities. It lies 3,113 feet (949 metres) above sea level, atop an east-west ridge in the Karnataka Plateau in the southeastern part of the state, at a cultural meeting point of the Kannada-, Telugu-, and Tamil-speaking peoples. Pop. (2001) city, 4,301,326; urban agglom., 5,701,446; (2011) city, 8,443,675; urban agglom., 8,520,435. 
        Large-scale immigration to Bangalore began in the 1950s as the state invested heavily in the public sector and in education. Employment opportunities were created for tens of thousands of people in southern India, and Bangalore grew to become one of the largest cities in the country. For several decades the city’s economic growth was based largely on manufacturing industries. In the early 1990s, however, a combination of new national economic liberalization policies and the emergence of a strong education system in the city encouraged the development of an information and communications technology (ICT) sector in Bangalore and paved the way for its rapid development into both a national and a global ICT centre.
